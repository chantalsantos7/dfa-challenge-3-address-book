# Domain Models, Class Diagrams and Test Plan

## User Stories

As a user, I want to have an address book to store all my contacts in so I can organise them easily.

As a user, I want to be able to add a contact's details to my address book so I don't lose track of their contact details.

As a user, I want to be able to remove a contact from my address book so I don't have to store contact information I no longer need.

As a user, I want to be able to search for a contact by their name and see their entry, so I can find their details without scrolling through the whole list.

As a user, I want to be able to edit a contact's details, so I can update the information in case they change their phone number or email.

As a user I don't want contacts to have duplicate phone numbers or emails to another contact, so I don't get confused about which contact has accurate information.

As a user, I want to be able to see all the contacts currently in my address book, so I can see how many contacts I have.

### Additional Requirement Stories

Generated by Copilot:
As a user, I want to be able to search for a contact by phone number so that I can quickly find the contact details associated with a specific phone number.

As a user, I want to be able to search for a contact by email address so that I can quickly find the contact details associated with a specific email address.

As a user, I want to be able to search for a contact by name, phone number, or email address and have the results displayed in alphabetical order so that I can easily find a contact even if I only remember part of their information.

As a user, I want to be able to delete all contacts at once, but I want to be asked to confirm this action before it proceeds so that I don't accidentally delete all my contacts.

## Test Plan

### AddressBook Tests

#### addContact
* Length of ArrayList<> contacts should increase by 1
* Adding a null Contact should throw an exception
* Should not be able to add a contact with a duplicate phone number or email

#### checkDuplicate
+ Will be tested in it's calling class, addContact
+ Should return true if the parameter is a duplicate of an existing Contact's phone number
+ Should return true if the parameter is a duplicate of an existing Contact's email
+ Should return false if the argument is not a duplicate of any data

#### removeContact

+ Length of ArrayList<> contacts should decrease by 1
+ removeContact will return true if successfully removed a Contact
+ Contact cannot be found in ArrayList<> contacts after calling this function
+ Trying to remove a Contact that isn't in already in the list will not affect the contacts list and will return false
+ Trying to remove a null contact should throw an exception
+ Trying to remove a contact when the list is empty should return false

#### findContact

+ Should return the first Contact that matches search criteria
+ Function should return a null if it cannot find the Contact
+ Should throw an error if a null object is passed to it

#### viewContacts

+ Should call a print statement for each element in the contacts list

#### deleteAllContacts

+ The contacts list should be empty after this function runs

### Contact Tests

#### Constructor(String name, String contactDetail, ContactType contactType)

+ If contactType is PHONE, should correctly set the phone number for this contact, not the email address
+ If contactType is EMAIL_ADDRESS, should correctly set the email address for this contact, not the email address

### ValidatorHelpers Tests

#### isInputNullOrEmpty

+ Should return true if String input is null
+ Should return true if String input is empty ("" or ' ');
+ Should return true if String input is whitespace (" ");
+ Should return false is String input is in any other form

#### validateContactInput

+ If contactDetailType is PHONE_NUMBER, return true if input matches PHONE_PATTERN
  + return false if it doesn't match PHONE_PATTERN
+ If contactDetailType is EMAIL_ADDRESS, return true if input matches EMAIL_PATTERN
  + return false if it doesn't match EMAIL_PATTERN
+ Should throw IllegalArgumentException if input is null or empty

### DisplayHelpers Tests

#### formatContact

+ Should return a String with the formatted details of each contact

# Task 1

This software aims to solve the inconveniences of managing a contacts list by allowing users to collect their contacts together and manage them from a single application. The user might have different contacts on separate devices - this software will help them unify their contacts list, providing a central database that has pruned possible duplicates. They will be able to either view all their contacts or find a specific contact, saving them time as it removes the need to search through multiple contact lists manually.

This software is DFCorp's second product, giving them a second income stream and likely increasing their total revenue. A successful launch of this product will make them more attractive to investors as having two successful products makes them more stable as a business. They can also access a new market with this software; the Secret Diary was likely more appealing to teenagers and young people, while the Address Book will be more useful to older customers, as they could use the application to manage business contacts.

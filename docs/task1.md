# Task 1

## Problem this software solves

* **Memory aid**: The address book serves as a memory aid so customers will not have to remember the contact details of any of their friends, family, coworkers, or acquaintances.
* **Organisation of contacts**: The address book software can help customers keep their contacts organised and easily accessible by providing a central location for storing and managing all contact information, so the user does not have to maintain separate contacts lists across several devices, which might not contain consistent information across all lists.

## Benefits to the user

* **Saves time searching for a contact**: The software has a search functionality that will allow the user to find a contact based on either their name, phone number or email address, so no matter what part of the contact the user remembers, they will be able to see the contact's details.
* **Able to update contact details**: The user can easily edit the details of any contact when necessary, so they will be able to maintain an up-to-date record of their contact information.
* **No duplicate contacts allowed**: Duplicate entries for a contact can cause confusion and inefficiency when trying to find someone's details, so the software checks if the contact the user is trying to add already exists in the address book, ensuring there will be no duplicate information attached to contacts that might no longer be accurate in other details.

## Benefits to the company

* As this is DFCorp's second product, it will give them a second income stream, and thus a chance to increase their total revenue.
* A successful launch of this product will make DFCorp more attractive to investors, as having two successful products makes them more stable as a business.
* DFCorp can access a new market with this software; the Secret Diary was likely more appealing to teenagers and young people, while the Address Book would be more useful to older customers, as they could use the application to manage business contacts.
